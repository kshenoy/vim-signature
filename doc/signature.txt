2. Mappings                                               *signature-mappings*

Out of the box, the followings mappings are defined by default

  mx           Toggle mark 'x' and display it in the leftmost column
  dmx          Remove mark 'x' where x is a-zA-Z

  m,           Place the next available mark
  m.           If no mark on line, place the next available mark. Otherwise,
               remove (first) existing mark.
  m-           Delete all marks from the current line
  m<Space>     Delete all marks from the current buffer
  ]`           Jump to next mark
  [`           Jump to prev mark
  ]'           Jump to start of next line containing a mark
  ['           Jump to start of prev line containing a mark
  `]           Jump by alphabetical order to next mark
  `[           Jump by alphabetical order to prev mark
  ']           Jump by alphabetical order to start of next line having a mark
  '[           Jump by alphabetical order to start of prev line having a mark
  m/           Open location list and display marks from current buffer

  m[0-9]       Toggle the corresponding marker !@#$%^&*()
  m<S-[0-9]>   Remove all markers of the same type
  ]-           Jump to next line having a marker of the same type
  [-           Jump to prev line having a marker of the same type
  ]=           Jump to next line having a marker of any type
  [=           Jump to prev line having a marker of any type
  m?           Open location list and display markers from current buffer
  m<BS>        Remove all markers

This will allow the use of default behavior of m to set marks and, if
the line already contains the mark, it'll be unset. The default behavior
of ]', [', ]` and [` is supported and enhanced by wrapping around when
beginning or end of file is reached. ]-, [-, ]= and [= also accept a count.

To directly jump to a given marker, the following maps can be used
>
  nnoremap [1 :call signature#marker#Goto('prev', 1, v:count)
  nnoremap ]1 :call signature#marker#Goto('next', 1, v:count)
  nnoremap [2 :call signature#marker#Goto('prev', 2, v:count)
  nnoremap ]2 :call signature#marker#Goto('next', 2, v:count)
<
etc. These are not defined by default


==============================================================================
3. Commands                                               *signature-commands*

SignatureToggleSigns

SignatureRefresh
  Force the display of signs in the buffer to refresh. Use this to correct
  the signs if things go awry

SignatureListMarks
  List all the marks used in the current buffer in the location list

SignatureListMarkers [marker]

4. Customization                                     *signature-customization*

                                                            *'g:SignatureMap'*
  Type: Dictionary, Default:
  To set up your own mappings copy the following dictionary and edit it
>
      let g:SignatureMap = {
        \ 'Leader'             :  "m",
        \ 'PlaceNextMark'      :  "m,",
        \ 'ToggleMarkAtLine'   :  "m.",
        \ 'PurgeMarksAtLine'   :  "m-",
        \ 'DeleteMark'         :  "dm",
        \ 'PurgeMarks'         :  "m<Space>",
        \ 'PurgeMarkers'       :  "m<BS>",
        \ 'GotoNextLineAlpha'  :  "']",
        \ 'GotoPrevLineAlpha'  :  "'[",
        \ 'GotoNextSpotAlpha'  :  "`]",
        \ 'GotoPrevSpotAlpha'  :  "`[",
        \ 'GotoNextLineByPos'  :  "]'",
        \ 'GotoPrevLineByPos'  :  "['",
        \ 'GotoNextSpotByPos'  :  "]`",
        \ 'GotoPrevSpotByPos'  :  "[`",
        \ 'GotoNextMarker'     :  "[+",
        \ 'GotoPrevMarker'     :  "[-",
        \ 'GotoNextMarkerAny'  :  "]=",
        \ 'GotoPrevMarkerAny'  :  "[=",
        \ 'ListLocalMarks'     :  "m/",
        \ 'ListLocalMarkers'   :  "m?"
        \ }
<
  By default, it defines the mappings as shown in |signature-mappings|
  To disable a map entirely, specify it as an empty string.
  If a key is not specified, the default value will be picked up.
  These same characters will be used to invoke the shortcuts.


                                                   *'g:SignatureIncludeMarks'*
  String, Default : 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'

  Specify the marks that can be controlled by this plugin.
  Only supports Alphabetical marks at the moment.
  'b:SignatureIncludeMarks' can be set separately for buffer-specific marks.


                                                 *'g:SignatureIncludeMarkers'*
  String, Default : '!@#$%^&*()'

  Specify the markers that can be used by the plugin.
  'b:SignatureIncludeMarkers' can be specified separately for each buffer


                               *g:SignatureMap['Leader']* *'SignatureMapLeader'*
  String, Default: 'm'

  Set the key used to toggle marks and markers.
  For eg. If this key is set to `<leader>m`,
    `<leader>ma`       will toggle the mark 'a' on the current line
    `<leader>m,`       will place the next available mark
    `<leader>m.`       will place the next available mark if there are no
                     marks already on the line; otherwise, will remove
                     first mark from line
    `<leader>m<Space>` will delete all marks
    `<leader>m1`       will toggle the marker '!'
    `<leader>m!`       will remove all the '!' markers
    `<leader>m<BS>`    will remove all markers

  Note:
  Currently, either marks or markers can be displayed in front of a line.
  Both can't be displayed simultaenously.

  To set this to mapleader or maplocalleader
>
    let g:SignatureMap['Leader'] = '<Leader>'
    let g:SignatureMap['Leader'] = '<LocalLeader>'
<

                                                      *'g:SignatureWrapJumps'*
  Boolean, Default : 1

  Specify if jumping to marks should wrap-around.
  'b:SignatureWrapJumps' can be set to specify buffer-specific settings.


                                                      *'g:SignatureMarkOrder'*
  String, Default : "\p\m"

  Signature allows you to display upto marks in front of a line. This controls
  the order in which marks are displayed.
    '\m' indicates the current or latest mark placed on the line
    '\p' indicates the previous mark placed on the line

  For eg,
    `g:SignatureMarkOrder="\m."`  : Display last mark with '.' suffixed
    `g:SignatureMarkOrder="_\m"`  : Display last mark with '_' prefixed
    `g:SignatureMarkOrder=">"`    : Display only a ">" for a line with a mark.
                                  The mark is not displayed
    `g:SignatureMarkOrder="\m\p"` : Display last two marks placed

  Note:
  The signs feature allows only 2 characters to be displayed. This is not and
  arbitratry limitation of the plugin.


                                                     *'g:SignatureMarkTextHL'*
  String, Default : 'Exception'

  The highlight group used for mark signs. This can be set to a function
  reference can be assigned to this to allow dynamic highlighting of signs
  NOTE: The quotes should be a part of the assignment.
  Eg.   let g:SignatureMarkTextHL = "'Exception'"


                                              *'g:SignatureMarkTextHLDynamic'*
  Boolean, Default: 0

  Highlight signs of marks dynamically based upon state indicated by
  vim-gitgutter or vim-signify


                                                     *'g:SignatureMarkLineHL'*
  String, Default : ''

  The highlight group used for hightlighting lines having mark signs.


                                                   *'g:SignatureMarkerTextHL'*
  String, Default : 'WarningMsg'

  The highlight group used for marker signs. This can be set to a function
  reference can be assigned to this to allow dynamic highlighting of signs
  NOTE: The quotes should be a part of the assignment.
  Eg.   let g:SignatureMarkTextHL = "'WarningMsg'"


                                            *'g:SignatureMarkerTextHLDynamic'*
  Boolean, Default: 0

  Highlight signs of markers dynamically based upon state indicated by
  vim-gitgutter or vim-signify


                                                   *'g:SignatureMarkerLineHL'*
  String, Default : ''

  The highlight group used for hightlighting lines having marker signs.


                                             *'g:SignatureDeleteConfirmation'*
  Boolean, Default: 0

  An option for the more clumsy-fingered of us. Asks for confirmation before
  moving/replacing/overwriting any marks


                                              *'g:SignaturePurgeConfirmation'*
  Boolean, Default: 0

  Similar to g:SignatureDeleteConfirmation. Asks for confirmation before
  deleting all marks/markers


                                                *'g:SignaturePeriodicRefresh'*
  Boolean, Default: 1

  Enable the display to refresh periodically. Generally a good thing to have.
  This makes use of the CursorHold autocmd event to execute periodically.
  The frequency of this event can be controlled by changing the value of the
  updatetime variable in milliseconds
    `set updatetime = 100`


                                                *'g:SignaturePrioritizeMarks'*
  Boolean, Default: 1

  When a line has both marks and markers, display the sign for marks. If set
  to 0, it will display the sign for markers instead


                                               *'g:SignatureEnabledAtStartup'*
  Boolean, Default: 1

  Control if the signs should be shown by default. If set to 0, the signs
  won't be visible until `:SignatureToggleSigns` has been called


                                                 *'g:SignatureDeferPlacement'*
  Boolean, Default: 1

  NOTE: Not supported currently. Code was highly inefficient.
  Check if any other plugin has already placed a sign and if set to 1,
  Signature will hold off from placing a sign. If set to 0, Signature will
  overwrite any signs that are already present.


                                    *'g:SignatureUnconditionallyRecycleMarks'*
  Boolean, Default: 0

  Controls behavior when trying to place next available mark and all marks
  have been used. If set to 0, then either an error or warning message will be
  emitted, depending on the setting of |g:SignatureErrorIfNoAvailableMarks|.
  If set to 1, then the first local mark (e.g., 'a') will be removed from its
  existing location and applied to the current line.


                                        *'g:SignatureErrorIfNoAvailableMarks'*
  Boolean, Default: 1

  Controls behavior when unable to place a new mark. If set to 1, then an
  error is raised. If set to 0, then just a warning message.


                                              *'g:SignatureForceRemoveGlobal'*
  Boolean, Default: 1

  Vim's handling of global marks is a bit iffy. This option forces the removal
  of global marks by deleting it from the .viminfo file.


                                             *'g:SignatureForceMarkPlacement'*
  Boolean, Default: 0

  When set to 1, will always place marks instead of toggling them


                                           *'g:SignatureForceMarkerPlacement'*
  Boolean, Default: 0

  When set to 1, will always place markers instead of toggling them
